HAPPY HIPPIE. 
Game based on true story ;)

STORY:
This is a simple story about Happy Hippie. Well...he was happy years ago. Now he ​misses​ his past ​life and cries over his present condition ​while working for some huge corporation. He has to wear a truly uncomfortable suit and shiny shoes. He had to cut his hair and hide his positive attitude behind the mask of indifference. You know ​that ​this is not the way of ​life ​that works ​for him so help him to get out of there before he loses all the joy of life. If that happens, he will become a low paid corpo-worker forever.


GOAL:
First of all, help him find the way out from the building on the first level, and from the building area on the second level. If you want to stay alive just watch for the level of happiness!

ENEMIES:
There ​are​​​ two ​groups​ of enemies who can decrease the level of happiness of your Happy Hippie. Ther​e​ is The Boss who can keep him ​in the office ​after ​regular ​hours (​if that's the case, happiness goes down). Just avoid him! ​Secondly, ​the​re​ are double-faced co-workers​ - n​ot the nicest guys either.​ Avoid them too!


Just stay happy and get out of there, your Dream​l​and somewhere far from here is waiting​ for you​:)
