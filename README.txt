HAPPY HIPPIE

This is a simple story about one Happy Hippie. Well...he was happy years ago. Now he cries over his past life while working for a business company, wearing a truly uncomfortable suit all day long. It's not the life for him. You have to help him.

Main goal:
First of all, help him find the way out.  Keep looking for powers, they can make him happy:) Just avoid the big boss because he will keep him after hours or his double-faced co-workers because they will make him sad! Just stay happy and get out of there!

To stay alive goal - stay happy (watch for your level of happiness)
